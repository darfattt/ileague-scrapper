## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- **RAM**: Minimum 8GB (16GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 15GB free space for model files
- **GPU**: Optional but recommended (CUDA-compatible for faster inference)

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

## Installation

### ðŸš¨ **IMPORTANT: NumPy Compatibility Fix**

**If you encounter the error `numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility`:**

This is caused by NumPy 2.0+ being incompatible with transformers. Use our automated setup:

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to the dashboard directory
cd isuperleague-player-streamlit/

# Run the automated setup script
python setup_ai_environment.py
```

The script will:
- Check system requirements (RAM, disk space)
- Create a virtual environment with compatible versions
- Install all dependencies in the correct order
- Validate the installation

### Option 2: Manual Fix for NumPy Error
```bash
# Fix NumPy compatibility
pip uninstall numpy
pip install "numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0"

# Install remaining dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 3: Clean Installation
```bash
# Navigate to the dashboard directory
cd isuperleague-player-streamlit/

# Install with compatible versions
pip install "numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0"
pip install "pandas>=2.0.0,<2.3.0"
pip install "torch>=2.1.0,<2.5.0"
pip install "transformers>=4.42.0,<4.46.0"
pip install "huggingface-hub>=0.16.4,<0.25.0"
pip install "accelerate>=0.20.0,<0.35.0"
pip install "sentencepiece>=0.1.99,<0.3.0"
pip install "streamlit>=1.28.0"
pip install "plotly>=5.15.0"
```

### First Run Setup
```bash
# Run the Streamlit application
streamlit run app.py
```

On first access to the AI Analyst page:
- Model download will begin automatically (5-7GB)
- Initial model loading may take 5-10 minutes
- Subsequent runs will be much faster

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. NumPy Binary Incompatibility Error
**Problem**: `RuntimeError: Failed to import transformers.pipelines because of the following error ... numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject`

**Cause**: NumPy 2.0.0+ (released June 2024) is incompatible with transformers library

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Quick Fix - Downgrade NumPy
pip uninstall numpy
pip install "numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0"
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or use automated setup
python setup_ai_environment.py
```

#### 2. Out of Memory Errors
**Problem**: System runs out of RAM during model loading
**Solutions**:
- Ensure minimum 8GB RAM available
- Close other memory-intensive applications
- Consider using a smaller model variant
- Enable GPU acceleration if available

#### 3. Slow Model Loading
**Problem**: Initial model load takes very long
**Solutions**:
- Ensure stable internet connection for download
- Model files are cached after first download
- Consider downloading manually to cache directory

#### 4. Import Errors
**Problem**: Missing dependencies
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Install missing packages with compatible versions
pip install "torch>=2.1.0,<2.5.0"
pip install "transformers>=4.42.0,<4.46.0"
pip install "accelerate>=0.20.0,<0.35.0"
pip install "sentencepiece>=0.1.99,<0.3.0"
```

#### 4. Analysis Quality Issues
**Problem**: AI responses not meeting expectations
**Solutions**:
- Provide more context in analysis inputs
- Use higher complexity levels for detailed insights
- Ensure sufficient player appearance data
- Try different phrasing for custom queries
